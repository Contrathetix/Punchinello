# Punchinello
An overwhelmingly bloatsome OBSE plugin to provide JSON file interface for Oblivion scripts, born out of my own need for a reasonable alternative to INI files. The plugin will end up using [the open source JSON library by Niels Lohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).

On another note, [Punchinello](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufIE9B3H85k) is also a march written by the British composer William Rimmer in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century.

It would be worth a note that my skills at C++ are absolutely horrible, so that whatever there may be here, it will probably not look pretty and will peform even worse than it looks.
