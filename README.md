# Punchinello
An overwhelmingly bloatsome OBSE plugin to provide JSON file interface for Oblivion scripts, born out of my own need for a reasonable alternative to INI files. This tiny little project, at its heart, is also mostly just me trying to learn how C++ works, which is also why 'quality' is not necessarily the best of words to use around here.

The plugin will end up using [the open source C++ JSON library by Niels Lohmann](https://github.com/nlohmann/json).
